## Lab 03 Instructions

<!-- - Create a “Top Ten” at the bottom of your HTML page as an ordered list in HTML. 
- Convert your work experience and education summary into an unordered list using HTML -->

- Add a 6th question to the guessing game that takes in a numeric input by prompting the user to guess a number.
- Indicates through an alert if the guess is “too high” or “too low”.
- It should give the user exactly four opportunities to get the correct answer.
- After all attempts have been exhausted, tell the user the correct answer. Consider using a loop of some sort.





- Add a 7th question that has multiple possible correct answers that are stored in an array.
- Give the user 6 attempts to guess the correct answer.
- The guesses will end once the user guesses a correct answer or they run out of attempts.
- Display all the possible correct answers to the user.
- Consider using a loop of some sort for this question.

- Keep track of the total number of correct answers. At the end tell them how many they got correct out of the 7 questions asked.

Continue using console longs throughout the code.
