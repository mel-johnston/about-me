      <p id="intro">Hello, my name is Melanie Johnston. I currently live in Dallas and am just focused on learning JavaScript. I
        don't have any prior tech experience, but I like languages and building things, so programming seemed like a
        good fit. So far, it has been a lot of fun and I am looking forward to all the things we will learn how to do.
